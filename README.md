**Testing platform for the eventual Circle-Up! application.**

This was an extremely fun v2 of the platform that ended up looking much better and functioning more of the way I intended for the final version.

I'm still deciding on the next step of either

- implementing a question prompt system that has a bot ask a question about a randomly tagged person in the circle for other people in the circle to answer. Those answers would then appear - anonymized - on the tagged person's profile. The goal of this would be to spark fun interactions in friend groups, benefiting new groups getting to know each other and old groups with nostalgia and stories - but both groups with humor and positive social interactions (hopefully).
- implementing a different authentication method and creating a Town Of Salem type game where with each circle, every individual user has access to one other individual user's profile for 24 hour periods with roles/teams assigned similar to Town of Salem. Eventually the Town of Salem game and features play out and either the mafiaso, town, or a random chaos role wins.

Then after deciding on that, it's adding the trivia / inner-circle password prompt as a fun authentication way to get in the circle

Going to pause this for now and come back to it, eventually...

1. deploying it for my friends to use for feedback
2. adding the ability to create or edit circles
3. then refactoring/polishing a bit
4. then maybe deploying for public use
