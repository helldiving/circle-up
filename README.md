**Testing platform for the eventual Circle-Up! application.**

This has been an extremely fun v2 of the platform so far and has ended up looking and functioning much better than the last one.

I'm still deciding on the next step of either

- implementing a question prompt system that has a bot ask a question about a randomly tagged person in the circle for other people in the circle to answer. Those answers would then appear - anonymized - on the tagged person's profile. The goal of this would be to spark fun interactions in friend groups, benefiting new groups getting to get to know each other and old groups with nostalgia and stories - but both groups with humor and positive social interactions (hopefully).
- implementing a different authentication method and creating a Town Of Salem type game where with each circle, every individual user has access to one other individual user's profile for 24 hour periods with roles/teams assigned similar to Town of Salem. Eventually the Town of Salem game and features play out and either the mafiaso, town, or a random chaos role wins.
- implementing a best friends feature that lists the top 3 people you talk to on the platform which is displayed on the users profile. Also allowing anonymous tagging where you can make a post tagging someone but your user name and profile avatar are set as anonymous.

Then after that, it's adding the trivia / inner-circle password prompt as a fun authentication way to get in the platform (circle)

To do:

1. deploy it for my friends to use for feedback
2. add the ability to create or edit circles and customizable invite screens
3. refactor/polish a bit
4. maybe deploy!
